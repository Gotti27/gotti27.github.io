### TL;DR

I'm a computer vision and software engineer at [DSI](https://www.digitalstrategyinnovation.it/), my work revolves around 3D reconstruction algorithms, in particular using stereo vision, feature matching and laser line scanners for industrial applications.
Other than that, I have focused on complex, containerized and scalable microservices architectures, and networking infrastructures.
Self-hosting and GNU/Linux enthusiast.

### Full story

I'm a computer vision and software engineer at [DSI](https://www.digitalstrategyinnovation.it/).
As introduced in the previous section, my work revolves around 3D computer vision pipelines, using stereo vision and laser line scanners.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, where I graduated with a final mark of 110/110 with honors.

During the summer between my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, I worked as a Java Developer at Zucchetti Software Giuridico in Pordenone, Italy.
Then, I collaborated with Ca' Foscari University of Venice on various cloud architectures, including a web platform for programming examinations, addressing the untrusted code execution issue ([Avogador]({% link _projects/avogador.md %})).
Between the first and second years of my Master's program, I completed a summer internship at [Univrses](https://univrses.com/), a computer vision company in Stockholm as full stack developer.

As a software developer, I've focused on Single Page Web Applications with complex, containerized, and scalable microservices architectures. Currently, I'm working on Computer Vision and Machine Learning topics. In particular, I've been studying and working on image processing, feature extraction, optical flow estimation, curves fitting, 2D-3D projective geometry for object reconstruction, pinhole camera model, convolutional neural networks and graph-based methods.

To broaden my technical skills, in my free time I manage my self-hosted network infrastructure and home lab, and I experiment with low level stuff and embedded programming.

I’ve also been involved in competitive programming and have participated in the following competition:

- SWERC 2020-2021/2022-2023
- Google HashCode 2020/2021/2022
- Google CodeJam 2021/2022
- Reply Code Challenge 2021/2022/2023
