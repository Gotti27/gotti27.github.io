### Full story
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, graduating with a final mark of 109/110.

During the summer between my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, I worked as Java developer at Zucchetti Software Giuridico in Pordenone, Italy. 
Currently, I am working on my Master's thesis in Computer Vision and 3D Reconstruction, to achieve a Master's degree in Computer Science (Software Development and Engineering) at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. 
Additionally, I collaborate with the University on various cloud architectures, including a web platform for programming examinations, addressing the "untrusted code execution" issue.

Between the first and second years of my Master's program, I completed a summer internship at Univrses, a computer vision company in Stockholm as full stack developer.

As a software developer, I have focused on Single Page Web Applications with complex, containerized, and scalable microservices architectures. Currently, I am transitioning towards Computer Vision and Machine Learning engineering, exploring their applications in embedded systems. In particular, I have been studying and working on image processing, feature extraction, optical flow estimation, curves fitting, 2D-3D projective geometry for object reconstruction, pinhole camera model and convolutional neural networks.

I am proficient in procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.
To broaden my technical skills, in my free time I manage my self-hosted network infrastructure and home lab, self-hosting various services.

I’m also involved in competitive programming and have participated in the following competition:
  - SWERC 2020-2021/2022-2023
  - Google HashCode 2020/2021/2022
  - Google CodeJam 2021/2022
  - Reply Code Challenge 2021/2022/2023
